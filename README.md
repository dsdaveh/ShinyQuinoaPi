### A shiny app example for estimating pi using Monte Carlo analysis

This is a simple example created in R demonstrating RStudio's *shiny* application.  It was created as a course project for Coursera's excellent [Developing Data Products](https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod) which is part of the even more awesome [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage) 

This example discusses Monte Carlo analysis as a means for estimating pi using random distributions, but is really intended as a means to show how easily and effectively visualizations can be created using R and R-Studio.

- A [presentation reviewing the shiny app is available here](https://rpubs.com/dsdaveh/29187)  
- The [app itself is available here](https://dsdaveh.shinyapps.io/QuinoaPi/)  
- All the code used to create the app is available on [github](https://github.com/dsdaveh/ShinyQuinoaPi)
